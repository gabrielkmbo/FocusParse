- Inspector chart tooling now allows a dynamic fallback for chart-family questions:
  generic `picture` regions with `figure_class=other` or `figure_class=screenshot`
  can use chart context / `chart_to_table` only when reranker evidence marks the
  region as primary or high-relevance. Explicit chart classes keep the previous
  path; weak generic visuals and non-chart questions remain blocked.
